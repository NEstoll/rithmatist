Idea:
Game based on the magic system in The Rithmatist by Brandon Sanderson


Knowns:
    General:
    Intent matters

    LoV:
    Higher frequency = better dmg
    Higher wavelength = better force
    can move LoW, at least a few inches (ch 20, end image)
    vanish once they hit something (ch. 1, duel)
    6 hits to break LoW, 10 for LoF (ch. 11, jordan defense)
    reflect off of LoF, but how? straight on hits don't
    can reflect at least 3 times and still deal dmg (ch 21, end image)
    LoF:
    Weaker at corners when touching (caused by touching or corner?)
    cannot be crossed (width = height of barrier)
    marks crosses are 
    LoW:
    Bind points are "created" as things are bound
    Everything is a 9 point
    9 points are from midpoint, altitude/side and altitude/2
    LoM:
    "better" drawn = stronger
    given commands after being drawn
    Go, turn, wait, attack, 
    




Plans/implementations:

Networking:
    Line creation is sent to server, "validated" and broadcast to all clients
    Occasionally server will ask clients about a specific line at a time, client must answer correctly
    Each client and server have a "game time" mesured in seconds/frames/etc.
