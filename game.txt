Idea:
Game based on the magic system in The Rithmatist by Brandon Sanderson


Knowns:
    General:
    Intent matters

    LoV:
    Higher frequency = better dmg
    Higher wavelength = better force
    LoF:
    Weaker at corners when touching (cuased by touching or corner?)
    LoW:
    Bind points are "created" as things are bound
    Everything is a 9 point
    9 points are from midpoint, altitude/side and altitude/2
    LoM:
    "better" drawn = stronger
    given commands after being drawn
    Go, turn, wait, attack, 
    




Plans/implementations:

Networking:
    Line creation is sent to server, "validated" and broadcast to all clients
    Occasionally server will ask clients about a specific line at a time, client must answer correctly
    Each client and server have a "game time" mesured in seconds/frames/etc.
